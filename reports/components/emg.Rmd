### `r animalId` `r cellName`

```{python}
prefix = f'{r.prefix}/{r.animalId}/{r.cellName}'

raw = pd.read_pickle(f'{prefix}/emg/raw.pkl')
data = pd.read_pickle(f'{prefix}/emg/filter.pkl')
movement_unfiltered = pd.read_pickle(f'{prefix}/emg/movement_events.pkl')
movement_events = pd.read_pickle(f'{prefix}/emg/filtered_movement_events.pkl')
no_movement_events = pd.read_pickle(f'{prefix}/emg/no_movement_events.pkl')
```

```{python, include = TRUE}
plot_all_events(data, channels = data.ch_names, movement = movement_events, no_movement = no_movement_events, limit = 10)
```

**Figure 1.** Good quality events after filtering. Good quality movement events are marked in **red**, good quality
no movement events are marked in **blue**.

#### Preprocessing

The EMG data were filtered to remove frequencies lower than `r config$filter$emg$drop_below` Hz
and higher than `r config$filter$emg$drop_above` Hz. The symmetric linear-phase FIR filter was used.
After filtering, the data were scaled using z-transform with the mean and standard deviations of the
complete sample data.

```{python, include = TRUE}
plot_all_events(raw, channels = raw.ch_names)
```

**Figure 2.** EMG data before filtering.

```{python, include = TRUE}
plot_all_events(data, channels = data.ch_names, limit = 10)
```

**Figure 3.** EMG data after filtering.

#### Movement Event Detection

```{python, include = TRUE}
plot_all_events(data, channels = data.ch_names, movement = movement_unfiltered, limit = 10)
```

**Figure 4.** All detected movement events.
