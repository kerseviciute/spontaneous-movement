### `r animalId` `r cellName`

```{python}
prefix = f'{r.prefix}/{r.animalId}/{r.cellName}'

data = pd.read_pickle(f'{prefix}/vm/filter.pkl')
movement_events = pd.read_csv(f'{prefix}/movement_final.csv')
```

The Vm data were not filtered nor centered.

```{python, include = TRUE, echo = FALSE}
plot_all_events(data, channels = range(0, len(data.ch_names)), movement = movement_events, limit = None, channel_col = 'ChannelID')
```

**Figure 1.** Good quality events after filtering, marked in the Vm data. Good quality movement events are marked
in **red**.
