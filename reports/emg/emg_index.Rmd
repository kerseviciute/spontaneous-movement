# EMG data preprocessing and movement event detection

The EMG data were filtered to remove frequencies lower than `r config$filter$emg$drop_below` Hz
and higher than `r config$filter$emg$drop_above` Hz. The symmetric linear-phase FIR filter was used.
After filtering, the data were scaled using z-transform with the mean and standard deviations of the
complete sample data.
